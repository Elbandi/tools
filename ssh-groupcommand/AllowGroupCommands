# This is useful because ssh client thinks she is issuing a shell
# command, therefore quoting arguments, but we are converting it
# to a pure execve(2) command-arguments sequence.
# N.B. This is NOT a real shell interpolation.
# So e.g. bash -c "echo '$LANG'" will result in ["echo", "$LANG"] 
# with literal string "$LANG".
