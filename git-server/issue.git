This is a lightweight git server. You can manage each of your
repositories by control files in the root directory on the special
'repo-mgmt' branch. Control file '/access': By default each repo is
private. You can make it public by putting "public" in it. You can delete
the repo by putting "delete" in it. Control file '/default-branch': write
the branch name in it (eg. 'master') you want to be the default when
cloning this repo.
