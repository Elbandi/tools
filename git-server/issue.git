This is a lightweight git server. You can manage each of your
repositories by the special 'repo-mgmt' branch. By default each repo is
private. You can make it public by putting "public" in the file
"/access" in the repo's root directory on the 'repo-mgmt' branch. You
can delete the repo by putting "delete" in the file "/access".
