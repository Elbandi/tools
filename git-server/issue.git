This is a lightweight git server. You can manage each of your
repositories by control files in the root directory on the special branch
called "repo-mgmt". Control file '/access': By default each repo is
private. You can make it public by writing "public" in it. You can delete
the repo by writing "delete" in it. Control file '/default-branch': write
the branch name in it (eg. "master") you want to be the default when
cloning this repo.
