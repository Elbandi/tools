=head1 NAME

seekstdin - Makes STDIN seekable for a given command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

seekstdin I<COMMAND> [I<ARGS>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Saves the content of STDIN into a temporary file,
then runs I<COMMAND>.
This is useful if I<COMMAND> does not support reading from pipe.
One of the reasons why reading from pipe is usually not supported
is that it is not seekable.
seekstdin(1) makes I<COMMAND>'s STDIN seekable by saving its own input
to a file which is unlinked right away,
so it won't occupy disk space once I<COMMAND> ends.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Impractical with huge files,
because they possibly do not fit on the temporary files' filesystem.
